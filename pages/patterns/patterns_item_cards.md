## Overview
Shows simple example for the component or feature.



## How it works

Defines how the component or app feature should function- this is the crux of the design. It should cover all supported platforms. Images and screens should be driven by Invision prototypes so that the content is kept up to date.

## Rules

Should define general rules. Such as:

* Items in the overflow will be defined by the Product.
* The item name should always be shown if available.
* The item name should truncate if itâ€™s longer than twenty characters.

## Variations 

Should detail different permutations for the component.

## Patterns in action 

Detail where the component is used.
